## Borwser

This command creates static documentation site from the given data. To create
a site you first create a directory and add a file named `metadata.json` in it.
This file contains configuration related to the site and the elements for which
the documentation is to be generated. You can also provide files to override the
default icon, favicon and site pages.

To get started first create a new documentation site.

```
ap-io browser -n myDocs
```

This will create a folder named `myDocs` with all the files necessary to generate
the site. If you don't provide a name to the command then a folder named `docs`
will be created. So, `cd` into the directory and generate the site.

```
cd myDocs && ap-io browser -g
```

This creates documentation site in folder `_site`. You can copy this folder for
deployment.

You can also specify the value of a config variable called `baseurl` while
generating the site. The `baseurl` is used in cases when you are hosting the
site in a subdirectory, for following url `https://atomproject.github.io/elements/about/`,
the site is hosted in a subdirectory called `elements`. To generate a site
in this case you should use the following command.

Eg.

```
ap-io browser -g --baseurl '/elements'
```


You can add elements to the `metadata.json` from command line. You can also
create an element first then add the element to the `metadata.json`.
To add an element run following command.

```
ap-io browser -e
```

It will ask for a bunch of things like element name, the bower install endpoint,
category etc. Once you provide those your `metadata.json` will be updated with
the new element.
